# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Will learn/review the new keywords-let, const and function/object syntax also shows how the new class, interface, module syntax can be used with JavaScript library like Angular, React, Node. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces, modules, import, export and statically typed like C# or Java. The popular JavaScript framework Angular 2.x and above versions are written in TypeScript. Mastering TypeScript can help developers and programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript, both on the server side and client side.

# Why TypeScript?
- Typescript got a similar syntax to JavaScript
- Typescript integrates easily into JavaScript projects
- TypeScript is extended JavaScript and superior to its other counterparts like `CoffeeScript` and `Dart` programming languages in a way that extends JavaScript
- Currently, it is used in many large projects and many libraries written/developed fully in Typescript:
  - `Google Angular 2.x` and greater version, 
  - `WinJS` (The Windows library for JavaScript) 
- The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature
- TypeScript comes with an optional static typing and types inference system through the `TLS (TypeScript Language Service)`
- Prevent bugs (data type)
- TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.
- Increases the code quality, readability and makes it an easy to maintain and refactor the code base
- Also integrated with task runners like Grunt & Gulp
- Rapid growth and use

# How Do I Started?
- Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/
- Open up your terminal window/command prompt (`cmd, git bash, node command prompt`) to run some of node commands
- Verify and check node installation/version by using command: `node -v`
- install typescript globally by using command: `npm install -g typescript`
- Verify typescript Installation by command: `tsc` (tsc = typescript compiler)
- Verify typescript Installation and version both with command: `tsc -v` or `tsc --version`
- Install and use some text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like `Notepad++, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code` to type code
