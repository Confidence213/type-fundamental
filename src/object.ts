//! OBJECT

// Creating type of object
// this is useful, because we can understand what type of value of some properties.
// example:
type User = {
    name: string,
    age: number,
    address: string
}

// Creating the object
// by using the User Type
// example:
const firstUser: User = {
    name: "Darmawan",
    age: 21,
    address: "Orchard Drive, Makassar"
}
